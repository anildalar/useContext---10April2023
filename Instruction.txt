What is the Problem?

How you can share the data in deep nested pages?

A.js (state  name="Anil")
		 B.js name="Anil"
					C.js name="Anil"
							.... name="Anil"
									...
												Z.js name="Anil"

Solution
1. Prop Drilling (Not recomended)
		What is props(properties) drilliing

		Sending data/state from top parent to deep child via props is called prop drilling
2. useContext (Best way/Efficent)

	2.1 We have to Create Context at the top level parent
